    <h4> Points Unknown | Housing Units Exposed Map </h4>
    <h1> Visualizing Wildfire Risks to Homes Across Florida. </h1>
    <p class="byline"> by Misha Vaid</p>
    <em><p>  This is an exploratory map that has not been vetted by scientific experts. It was made as an assignment for the Points Unknown Web Mapping Class in June 2022.</p> </em>
    <p> <em>Data source: U.S. Forest Services's <a href="https://wildfirerisk.org/download/">Wildfire Risk to Communities</a> accessed through <a href="https://brown-institute-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Objects/pointsunknown/WildfireRiskToCommunities_County_Summary_2020-03-31.xlsx">The Brown Institute</a>.

    <p> According to a <a href="https://southeastfloridaclimatecompact.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RCAP_Wildfire_Risk_Reduction_in_FL.pdf">2020 Report</a> by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Forestry, migration patterns are the biggest cause for concern when it comes to wildfire prevention in the state. 
        "We continue to see the population growing in Floridaâ€™s wildland-urban interface areas. The number of wildfires impacting
        residents and suppression costs also continue to grow."
    </p>
    <p> But which counties are more at risk?</p>

    <p> One way to measure Wildfire risk, is to look at every county's total number of exposed Housing Units as a percentage of the total number of units. </p>

    <p> But what exactly does this metric mean? According to the USDA wesbite, "Housing Unit Exposure is the expected number of housing units within a pixel potentially exposed to wildfire in a year. This is a long-term annual average and not intended to represent the actual number of housing units exposed in any specific year."</p>
